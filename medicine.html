        <h3 class="">Telemedicine</h3>
        <p>Telemedicine refers to using phones and other communication devices to provide remote medical care. This means patients can be evaluated, diagnosed, and treated without the need for an in-person visit. This approach enhances access to healthcare, particularly for those in rural or underserved areas, and has become increasingly vital in improving patient outcomes and managing chronic conditions.</p>

        <p>The history of telemedicine dates back to the early 20th century when the first experiments in remote healthcare began to take shape. In the 1920s, radio was used for consultations between doctors and patients in remote locations, marking one of the earliest instances of telemedicine. The introduction and popularisation of phones (first landline then mobile) further accelerated these developments, enabling more immediate communication between healthcare providers and patients.</p>
            
        <p>By the 1960s, telemedicine gained momentum as various medical institutions, such as the Massachusetts General Hospital, began exploring video technology to connect specialists with patients in rural areas. The advent of satellite communication in the 1970s and 1980s further expanded telemedicine's reach, allowing for real-time consultations and the transmission of medical data.</p>
            
        <p>The 1990s and early 2000s saw significant advancements with the rise of the internet, leading to the development of telehealth platforms that provided a wider array of services, including remote monitoring and online consultations. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 acted as a catalyst for telemedicine, prompting healthcare systems worldwide to adopt and expand virtual care solutions at an unprecedented pace. Today, telemedicine continues to evolve, incorporating artificial intelligence and mobile health applications to further enhance patient care and accessibility.</p>
